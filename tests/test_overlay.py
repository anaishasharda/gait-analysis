"""The annotated playback video.

The end-to-end tests render a real file and inspect it with ffprobe, because the
failure this code exists to guard against is one that looks like success: at some
frame sizes OpenCV's H.264 writer reports ``isOpened() == True``, fails to load
its encoder, and writes about a kilobyte of nothing. Only the output tells the
truth, so the output is what gets checked.
