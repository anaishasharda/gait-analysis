RECORDING_GUIDANCE = """
**In order of how much it matters.** These come from what actually went wrong on
real pilot recordings, not from theory.

1. **Two to three passes back and forth, in one recording.** This is the most
   common reason a session cannot be measured. There is a hard trade-off: framed
   well, a person filling half the frame covers most of it in two or three
   strides, so a single walk-past yields two to five strides where ten are
   needed for a variability figure. You cannot fix this by zooming out. That
   just makes the subject too small. Walk them up and back, two or three times,
   in the same clip.
2. **Fill at least half the frame height with the person.** Foot position can
   only be located to within a pixel or two, so how big they are in frame sets
   the precision of everything. Head to floor, with a little room to spare.
3. **Legs and ankles visible.** Loose or flowing trousers hide the knee and
   ankle, and the tracker then *infers* where they are rather than seeing them.
   Producing confident, wrong numbers. Fitted trousers, leggings, shorts, or
   loose trousers rolled up.
4. **Fixed camera, square to the walking path.** On a tripod or propped against
   something solid. Never handheld, and never following the person. Stand level
   with the middle of the path so they cross the frame sideways rather than
   moving towards or away from you.
5. **Whole walk inside the frame.** Start recording once the person is already
   fully in shot and walking, and stop only after they have finished. Feet must
   stay above the bottom edge throughout.
6. **60 fps.** At 25–30 fps the gap between frames is as large as the
   stride-to-stride variation being measured, which degrades the single most
   fall-risk-predictive metric to indicative only.
7. **Only the walker in shot.** Bystanders in the background can make the
   tracker jump to a different person mid-recording.
8. **Record assistive-device use in the sidebar.** Pose estimation cannot see a
   cane. It detects bodies, not objects.

After analysing, the **How to improve the recording** section tells you which of
these applied to your clip and what to change.
