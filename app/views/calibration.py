"""Page: the camera setup -- how much floor the camera's view covers.

Walking speed is the one measure that needs a real-world distance; everything
else is scale-free. The setup asks for it in the form a person can actually
measure with a tape: the length of floor the picture spans, along the line the
person walks. Analysis is locked until it is entered (see ``analyse.py``),
because speed is the measure the pilot most wants to show.

The two older ways of getting a scale -- from a walk over a known distance, and
from two marked points in a frame -- are kept as alternatives. Both now produce
the same thing: a coverage length, stored as the one camera setup.
