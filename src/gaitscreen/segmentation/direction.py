"""Direction of progression and splitting a recording into walk passes.

Every spatial gait measure is defined along the *anterior* axis, not along image
``x``. Getting that axis wrong flips heel strike and toe-off, so it is resolved
explicitly rather than assumed.

Direction is taken from the feet, not from the hips. Hip velocity is the obvious
choice and fails on exactly the footage this project has: treadmill, in-place and
camera-tracked recordings have no net hip translation, so its sign is noise. The
foot's own anterior axis -- toe ahead of heel -- is a body-fixed reference that
survives all three cases. Facing direction from the head is used as a tie-break,
and hip velocity only as a last resort.
