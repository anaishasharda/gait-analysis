"""Session data-quality scoring.

A single score in [0, 1] combining the things that actually determine whether a
session's numbers can be trusted: how well the gait-critical landmarks were seen,
how many complete strides were recovered, the frame rate, the pose detection
rate, and whether an assistive device was in use.

Sessions scoring below the configured threshold are marked ``low_confidence``.
They are still stored and still reported -- hiding a session would hide the fact
that data collection is degrading -- but they are excluded from personal baseline
computation, so a bad recording cannot silently redefine what "normal" means for
that user.
