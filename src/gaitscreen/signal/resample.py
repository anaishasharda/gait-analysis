"""Gap handling on a uniform time base.

Two rules drive this module:

1. **Never drop frames.** Both the zero-phase filter and the peak detector
   assume evenly spaced samples. Removing low-visibility frames would compress
   the time axis and shorten every stride time it touched -- a systematic bias
   in exactly the metric the tool cares most about.
2. **Never interpolate across a long gap.** A short dropout (a few frames of
   the far leg passing behind the near leg) interpolates cleanly. A long one
   means the limb was genuinely unobserved, and inventing a trajectory there
   would invent gait events with it. Long gaps split the recording into separate
   analysis segments instead.

    in a sagittal view, a single point of failure: on pilot footage it was
    present for only 60% of frames with a longest clean run of 1.4s, while every
    foot landmark had continuous runs above six seconds. Knees matter for the
    angle curves, and those degrade on their own where a knee is missing.

    floor is a multiple of the *minimum* stride time. Using the maximum stride
    time instead demands 2.5s of unbroken tracking to measure a 0.9s stride,
