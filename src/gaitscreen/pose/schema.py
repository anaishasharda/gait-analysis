"""MediaPipe BlazePose landmark schema (33 landmarks).

Index order is fixed by the model; see the enum below. Two properties of the
raw output drive design decisions elsewhere in this package:

* ``x`` is normalised by image *width* and ``y`` by image *height*
  independently, so raw normalised coordinates are **anisotropic**. Any
  distance or angle computed before scaling back to pixels is silently wrong on
  non-square frames. See :mod:`gaitscreen.pose.to_pixels`.
* ``z`` is a depth estimate relative to the hip midpoint, in units that are
  neither metric nor reliable. It is archived but never computed from.
