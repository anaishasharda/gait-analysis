"""The camera setup: how much floor the camera's view covers.

This is the simplest calibration that still gives walking speed in metres per
second. Two tape marks go on the floor along the line the person walks, one at
the left edge of the picture and one at the right; the distance between them is
the *coverage length*. Divided by the frame width it is the size of one pixel
at the walking line, and that is all a side-on speed measurement needs.

It is stored once per camera setup rather than per person, because it describes
where the camera stands, not who walks past it. Three consequences follow, and
each is handled here rather than left to the caller:

* **Resolution.** A pixel scale does not survive a change of video size, and
  the stored-calibration check refuses one made at a different resolution. The
  coverage length does survive -- it is a physical distance across the whole
  frame -- so a calibration is built for each video at that video's own width.
* **Camera drift.** The per-person setup could notice a moved camera from the
  subject's height in pixels. A shared setup cannot, because different people
  are different heights, so that check is not attempted.
* **Storage.** Calibrations are keyed by person in the database, so the setup
  is stored under a reserved id that the app keeps out of the person lists.
