"""Plain-language presentation of a session's results.

The metrics layer speaks in the vocabulary of gait analysis -- "stride-time
coefficient of variation", "double-support percentage", "trunk AP sway
normalised by leg length". That is the right vocabulary for the pipeline and the
wrong one for the person reading the result, who is usually a caregiver or a
family member rather than a gait lab.

This module is the translation layer, and it is only translation: it derives
everything from the metrics and flags already computed, and adds no analysis of
its own. Keeping it separate means the wording can be revised for
comprehensibility without any risk of changing what the tool measures.

Three rules on the wording, all of which follow from this being a screening tool:

* **No diagnostic language.** A metric outside its threshold is "worth
  discussing", never "abnormal". The tool cannot diagnose, so its vocabulary
  should not imply that it has.
* **Absence is a distinct state, not a bad result.** "Not measured" gets its own
  status and its own plain reason. Showing it as zero, or blank, or lumped in
  with a normal reading, would each be a different kind of lie.
* **Direction is stated, because it is not guessable.** For speed, higher is
  better; for variability and asymmetry, lower is. A reader cannot infer that
  from the number, so each metric says which way is good.
